By Jan Wilczek from TheWolfSound.com.

This repository contains the source code of my tutorial on how to build a wavetable synthesizer on
Android.

## Project Goal

The goal of the app is to build a wavetable synthesizer on Android with basic controls. You can see
them in the user interface (UI) of the app.

_Graphical user interface of the synthesizer app._

The secondary goal is to use cutting-edge Android tools and practices like

* [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/),
* [Jetpack Compose UI framework](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose),
* [Oboe audio library](https://github.com/google/oboe),
* and [modern Android architecture guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).
